🧑‍💻 Introduction
Machine Learning (ML) and Data Science rely on several key frameworks for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis. The most widely used ones include:

NumPy for numerical computing

Pandas for data manipulation

Matplotlib for data visualization

Seaborn for statistical data visualization

These libraries form the foundation of any ML or data science project.

⚙️ Installation
To install all required libraries, use:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
Or install them individually:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install numpy  
pip install pandas  
pip install matplotlib  
pip install seaborn  
📚 Framework Overviews
🔢 NumPy (Numerical Python)
NumPy is a powerful library for numerical computing. It provides support for multi-dimensional arrays, mathematical functions, and linear algebra.

✔️ Key Features:

Efficient array operations

Mathematical and statistical functions

Linear algebra, Fourier transforms, and random number generation

🔹 Example Usage:

python
Copy
Edit
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print("NumPy Array:", arr)
print("Mean:", np.mean(arr))
📊 Pandas (Data Manipulation & Analysis)
Pandas is an essential library for data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis using data structures like DataFrames and Series.

✔️ Key Features:

Handling missing data

Data filtering and transformation

Reading and writing data in different formats (CSV, Excel, SQL)

🔹 Example Usage:

python
Copy
Edit
import pandas as pd

data = {'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'], 'Age': [25, 30, 35]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)
📈 Matplotlib (Data Visualization)
Matplotlib is a widely used plotting library that enables the creation of static, animated, and interactive visualizations.

✔️ Key Features:

Supports line, bar, scatter, histogram, and pie charts

Highly customizable

Works well with Pandas and NumPy

🔹 Example Usage:

python
Copy
Edit
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [10, 20, 25, 30, 40]

plt.plot(x, y, marker='o', linestyle='-', color='b', label="Line Chart")
plt.xlabel("X-axis")
plt.ylabel("Y-axis")
plt.title("Sample Plot")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
🎨 Seaborn (Statistical Data Visualization)
Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib and is used for statistical data visualization with beautiful themes and enhanced readability.

✔️ Key Features:

Simple interface for creating complex plots

Built-in themes and color palettes

Works seamlessly with Pandas

🔹 Example Usage:

python
Copy
Edit
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample dataset
tips = sns.load_dataset("tips")

# Create a scatter plot
sns.scatterplot(x="total_bill", y="tip", data=tips)
plt.title("Seaborn Scatter Plot")
plt.show()
🔥 Examples & Usage
